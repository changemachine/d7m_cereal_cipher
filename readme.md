# CEREAL CIPHER! #

The Cereal Cipher module allows you to encode text using the shift-cipher (AKA Caesar cipher) method of encryption.  This is very low-level encryption, and is about as secure as pig-latin.

## Installation ##

(Requires [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)

1. Clone the cereal_cipher folder into the appropriate modules folder of your site (ie, /sites/all/modules/gathercontent/).
2. Enable the module in Drupal's Modules menu


## Support ##
This module is unsupported, and may break everything it touches, or fall apart in soft breezes. [james@changemachine.org](mailto:james@changemachine.org).
